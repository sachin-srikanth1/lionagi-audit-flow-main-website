“Design a modern AI automation landing page with a console-inspired aesthetic.
Key requirements:
    •    Hero Section: Bold headline ‘Your AI Vision, Built and Running’ with animated subline ‘In Weeks — Not Years’. Add credibility line beneath: ‘Powering $2M+ in automated AI decisions daily’.
    •    CTAs: One glowing neon button (cyan or green) as the primary call-to-action, secondary button styled as subtle ghost text.
    •    Savings Cards: Three visual cards with icons (invoice, resume, customer feedback). Each card shows manual vs automated times and dollar savings. Add hover animations or glowing borders.
    •    Process List: Replace static checklist with a live terminal log style animation. Example: > Extract invoice data... ✔  
> Validate formats... ✔  
> Parse line items... ✔  
Steps should auto-animate in sequence.

    •    Proof & Social Trust: Add a horizontal strip for client logos (or anonymized placeholders like ‘Enterprise HR’, ‘VC Firms’, ‘DeepTech Startups’) and one testimonial box with measurable outcome.
    •    Visual Style: Dark background with animated gridlines or glowing node network. Use monospace font sparingly for terminal feel. Accent colors: neon green or cyan.
    •    Typography: Bold sans-serif for headlines, light gray body text, highlight key numbers in bright accent and larger font size.
    •    Layout Flow: Hero → Credibility line → Savings cards → Animated process log → Proof/testimonials → Strong single CTA.

Overall tone: futuristic, credible, alive. Should blend ROI clarity with hacker-console personality.”
